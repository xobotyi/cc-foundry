### Output Styles

- **Software Engineer** — Implementation-focused persona. Applies
  engineering judgment, enforces discovery-first workflow, uses LSP
  tools for code navigation.

  task. Interrupts assumption-based reasoning and enforces verification
  of APIs, signatures, and dependencies before implementation.
