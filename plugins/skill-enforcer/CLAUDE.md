# Skill Enforcer Plugin

This plugin enforces skill evaluation at key lifecycle points during
your session. It uses XML tags as checkpoints that require action
before proceeding.

## How It Works

The plugin injects a Skill Enforcement Framework (SEF) at session start,
then triggers evaluation checkpoints via hooks:

- **Session start**: Full framework definition loaded
- **User prompt**: Evaluate skills before any tool use
- **After Read**: Evaluate skills after context gathering
- **After Edit/Write**: Check for phase transitions
- **After Skill**: Consider batch skill invocations

## SEF Tags

When you see these tags, you MUST act on them:

| Tag | Trigger | Required Action |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| `SEF_PROMPT` | User prompt | Evaluate and invoke skills before proceeding |
| `SEF_EVAL` | After Read | Check if gathered context requires skills |
| `SEF_PHASE` | After Edit/Write | Assess if phase changed (coding→testing→review) |
| `SEF_REFS` | After Skill | Check for batch invocation opportunities |

## Compliance

Acknowledging a tag without acting is a violation.

### Required Output (Chain-of-Thought)

You MUST state your evaluation result in thinking before tool use:

```
SEF: [domain] → invoke [skills] | none needed
SEF: phase [current] → re-read [refs] | same phase
SEF: batch [additional skills] | complete
```

### Self-Verification

After invoking skills, verify: Did I call Skill() for each identified
skill, or only acknowledge them in text? If acknowledge-only, invoke NOW.

### Workflow

1. Tag appears → pause current workflow
2. Evaluate using tag's steps
3. Output evaluation result in thinking
4. Invoke missing skills
5. Verify invocations happened
6. Continue with original task
