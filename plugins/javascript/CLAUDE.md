# javascript Plugin

JavaScript and TypeScript language discipline plugin. Teaches JS/TS-specific
conventions, patterns, runtime practices, and testing.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `javascript` | Core JavaScript language conventions, idioms, and modern practices |
| `typescript` | TypeScript type system and TS-specific patterns (extends `javascript`) |
| `nodejs` | Node.js runtime conventions and APIs |
| `bun` | Bun runtime conventions and APIs |
| `vitest` | Vitest testing framework conventions and practices |

## Plugin Scope

This plugin covers JavaScript and TypeScript language specifics and their
runtimes. Language-agnostic coding practices are provided by the `the-coder`
plugin. Platform-specific concerns (frontend, backend, CLI) are provided by
their respective platform plugins.

## Skill Dependencies

The `typescript` skill extends `javascript` — both should be active when
working with TypeScript code. The `javascript` skill stands alone for pure
JS projects.
