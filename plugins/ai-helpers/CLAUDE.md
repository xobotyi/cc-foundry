Skills for creating and improving AI artifacts: prompts, skills, subagents,
and output styles.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `prompt-engineering` | Craft, debug, improve prompts for any AI context |
| `skill-engineering` | Create, evaluate, iterate Claude Code skills |
| `subagent-engineering` | Build and debug Claude Code subagents |
| `output-style-engineering` | Create Claude Code output styles |

## Skill Dependencies

All skills share a foundation:

```
prompt-engineering (foundation)
    ↑
    ├── skill-engineering (skills are prompts)
    ├── subagent-engineering (agent prompts are system prompts)
    └── output-style-engineering (styles are system prompts)
```

When writing skills, subagents, or output styles, invoke `prompt-engineering`
for complex instruction design.

## Skill Structure Pattern

Each skill follows the same structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main file: frontmatter + core instructions
├── references/        # Detailed docs loaded on-demand
│   ├── spec.md        # Technical specification
│   ├── creation.md    # How to create from scratch
│   ├── evaluation.md  # Quality criteria
│   └── iteration.md   # Improvement patterns
└── .dev/              # Development artifacts (not shipped)
    └── reference/     # Source materials used during creation
```

## Conventions

**Descriptions:** Use `what + when` formula:
```yaml
description: >-
  [What it does]. Use when [specific trigger scenarios].
```

**References:** Route to specific files instead of duplicating content.
Use a routing table in SKILL.md to direct users.

**Prompt engineering:** All AI artifact skills reference `prompt-engineering`
because prompts are foundational to skills, subagents, and output styles.
