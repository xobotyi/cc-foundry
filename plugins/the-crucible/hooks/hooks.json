If stop_hook_active is true in the input, respond immediately: {\"ok\": true}\n2. If the conversation was a simple question, greeting, or discussion (no task execution), respond: {\"ok\": true}\n3. For task work:\n   a. Find and read the quality-validation skill: Glob for \"**/quality-validation/SKILL.md\", then Read it\n   b. Apply every validation criterion from that skill to evaluate the deliverable\n   c. Check every item in the skill's pre-completion checklist\n4. Respond: {\"ok\": true} if complete, or {\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"what's missing\"} if not\n\nBe strict about completeness. Be lenient about style. Never block for minor improvements.",
