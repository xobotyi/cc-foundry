# backend

Backend platform discipline for service-oriented development.

## The Problem

Building reliable services requires consistent approaches to observability, API design, and
infrastructure patterns. Without standardized practices, teams reinvent logging strategies,
monitoring conventions, and service architectures on every project.

## The Solution

This plugin provides backend platform skills that encode proven practices for building services,
operators, workers, and daemons. It focuses on platform-level concerns that apply across
languages—structured logging, observability patterns, API design, and service architecture.

## Installation

```
/plugin marketplace add xobotyi/cc-foundry
/plugin install backend
```

## Skills

### logging

Logging conventions, structured logging, and log level practices. **Use when:** adding,
reviewing, refactoring, or debugging logging in service code, or when establishing observability
patterns.
