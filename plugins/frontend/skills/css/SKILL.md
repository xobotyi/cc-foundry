# CSS

**Predictability is the highest CSS virtue. If your styles require `!important`
to work, restructure the cascade.**

CSS rewards explicit, low-specificity selectors and intentional cascade
ordering. Prefer boring, readable patterns over clever one-liners.

## Selectors and Specificity

- Single class selectors by default — keep specificity flat at 0-1-0
- Never use ID selectors for styling — IDs are for anchors and JS hooks
- Never qualify classes with elements — `.error` not `div.error`
- Max nesting depth: 3 levels — deeper nesting couples CSS to DOM structure
- Avoid `!important` — use cascade layers or restructure selectors instead;
  only valid use is in a low-priority reset layer for truly essential styles
- Use `:where()` to zero-out specificity when needed —
  `:where(.card) .title` has 0-0-1 specificity
- Use `:is()` with awareness — it takes the highest specificity of its arguments
- Flatten nested selectors in SCSS — ability to nest does not mean you should

## Layout Systems

### Choosing Flexbox vs Grid

| Use Case | System |
|----------|--------|
| One-dimensional flow (row or column) | Flexbox |
| Two-dimensional layout (rows AND columns) | Grid |
| Content-driven sizing | Flexbox |
| Layout-driven sizing | Grid |
| Component internals (nav items, card content) | Flexbox |
| Page-level structure, complex arrangements | Grid |
| Items need to wrap naturally | Flexbox |
| Precise placement on named lines/areas | Grid |

Both work together — a grid item can be a flex container and vice versa.

### Flexbox

- Always use the `flex` shorthand — it sets intelligent defaults.
  See `references/layout.md` for the full shorthand value table
- `flex-flow: row wrap` combines `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`
- Use `flex-wrap` with a `flex` basis for responsive layouts without media queries:
  `flex: 1 1 300px` wraps items when they can't maintain 300px minimum
- Centering: `display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center`
  or `margin: auto` on a flex child
- `gap` over margin hacks — works in both flexbox and grid
- Avoid `justify-content: space-between` with wrap — causes orphan gaps;
  prefer `gap` + `flex-wrap`

### CSS Grid

- `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))` is the canonical responsive grid — no media
  queries needed
- Prefer `auto-fit` over `auto-fill` — `auto-fit` expands columns to fill space;
  `auto-fill` keeps empty tracks
- Use named grid areas for page-level layouts — they auto-create named lines
- Never hardcode `px` widths on grid items — use `fr`, `minmax()`, or `auto`
- `grid-auto-flow: dense` fills visual holes — use carefully, it breaks
  visual/source order alignment (a11y concern)
- Never use `order` in ways that break logical reading order
- See `references/layout.md` for subgrid, implicit rows, alignment shorthands,
  and negative line numbers

### General Layout Rules

- Never use `float` for layout — floats are for wrapping text around images
- Intrinsic sizing first — use `flex-wrap`, `min()`, `max()`, `clamp()` before
  reaching for media queries
- `gap` over margin hacks in both flexbox and grid

## CSS Nesting

- Use `&` for pseudo-classes/elements and compound selectors —
  `&:hover`, `&::before`, `&.active`
- Omit `&` for descendant selectors — `.card { .title {} }` works
- `&` is required when the nested selector starts with a type selector —
  `& p {}` not `p {}`
- Nesting at-rules (`@media`, `@supports`, `@container`) nest directly inside rules
- Specificity: `:is()` wrapping applies in nesting — be aware that specificity
  may differ from the equivalent unnested selector
- Max depth: 3 levels — same rule as flat CSS

## Cascade Layers (`@layer`)

- Declare all layers at the top of the stylesheet in a single statement:
  `@layer reset, defaults, themes, components, utilities;`
- First declared = lowest priority; un-layered styles always beat layered styles
- `!important` reverses layer order — `!important` in the lowest layer wins over
  `!important` in higher layers
- Import third-party CSS into sub-layers:
  `@import url('vendor.css') layer(vendor.bootstrap);`
- Use `revert-layer` to roll back to the previous layer's value
- `!important` in low layers is intentional — it means "this style is essential,
  don't override"
- Don't create layers per-component — layers manage cascade priority between
  categories (reset vs component vs utility), not scope
- Nested layers: `@layer components { @layer buttons, cards; }` —
  access via `@layer components.buttons`
- Anonymous layers (`@layer { }`) can't be appended to later

## Container Queries

- Define containment: `container-type: inline-size` on the wrapper
- Name containers for targeting: `container: card / inline-size`
- Query by name: `@container card (width > 400px) { }`
- Unnamed queries hit the nearest ancestor container

### Container Query Units

| Unit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `cqw` / `cqh` | 1% of container width / height |
| `cqi` / `cqb` | 1% of container inline / block size |
| `cqmin` / `cqmax` | Smaller / larger of `cqi` or `cqb` |

Use `cqi` instead of `vw` for container-scoped fluid values:
`font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5cqi + 0.5rem, 2rem)`

## Responsive Design

### Responsive Hierarchy

Design from the inside out — use the right tool for each level:

| Level | Tool | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Content-driven | Flexbox wrapping, `min()`/`max()`/`clamp()` | Always — baseline |
| Container-driven | Container queries, `cqi`/`cqw` units | Component adapts to parent |
| Viewport-driven | Media queries, `vw`/`vh`/`dvh` | Page-level layout changes |
| User preference | `prefers-*` media queries | Color scheme, motion, contrast |

### Core Rules

- Mobile-first — default styles for small screens, enhance upward
- Content-driven breakpoints — let content decide, not device sizes
- `rem` for breakpoints: `@media (width >= 45rem)` not `(min-width: 768px)`
- Use modern range syntax: `@media (768px <= width < 1024px)`
- Logical properties for layout: `margin-inline-start` not `margin-left`
- Container queries for component-level adaptation; media queries only for
  viewport-dependent elements (nav, header)
- Respect user preferences: `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-color-scheme`,
  `prefers-contrast`
- Single container max-width pattern: `width: min(100% - 2rem, 75rem);
  margin-inline: auto` — avoid multiple `max-width` values at different breakpoints

### Fluid Sizing

- `clamp(min, preferred, max)` for fonts, spacing, and container widths
- Build a fluid type scale with custom properties:
  `--step-0: clamp(1rem, 0.5rem + 1.5vw, 1.25rem)`
- Never use `vw` alone for font size — it blows up on large screens;
  always pair with `clamp()` and `rem`
- Use `cqi` instead of `vw` for container-scoped fluid values

### Logical Properties

Use logical properties for layout-sensitive values (margins, padding, borders,
text alignment, positioning offsets). Physical properties are fine for visual
effects not affected by writing direction (e.g., box-shadow offsets).

| Physical | Logical |
|----------|---------|
| `left` / `right` | `inline-start` / `inline-end` |
| `top` / `bottom` | `block-start` / `block-end` |
| `width` / `height` | `inline-size` / `block-size` |
| `margin-left` | `margin-inline-start` |
| `padding-top` | `padding-block-start` |
| `text-align: left` | `text-align: start` |

Shorthands: `margin-block: 1rem 2rem` (block-start, block-end);
`margin-inline: auto` (both inline directions).

### User Preference Queries

- Color scheme: declare `color-scheme: light dark` on `:root` and use
  `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` for overrides
- Reduced motion: either remove motion in `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` or
  add motion only in `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` (progressive
  enhancement approach)
- High contrast: `@media (prefers-contrast: more)`
- Interaction: `@media (hover: hover)` for hover effects on capable devices;
  `@media (pointer: coarse)` for touch targets (min 44px)

### Responsive Images

- `img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; }`
- Use `aspect-ratio` + `object-fit: cover` for hero images

## The `:has()` Selector

Select elements based on descendants or siblings — the "parent selector."

- Anchor to specific elements, not `body`, `:root`, or `*` — broad anchors
  force expensive re-evaluation on every DOM change
- Use direct child (`>`) or sibling (`+`, `~`) combinators inside `:has()`
  to limit traversal scope
- Cannot nest `:has()` inside `:has()`
- Pseudo-elements are not valid inside `:has()`
- `.layout:has(> .sidebar-open)` (good) not `body:has(.sidebar-open)` (bad)

## Custom Properties

- Define design tokens on `:root` — scope overrides to components
- Semantic naming: `--color-text-primary` not `--dark-gray`
- Use kebab-case; prefix with category: `--color-`, `--spacing-`, `--font-`
- Provide fallbacks for component-level variables:
  `var(--button-bg, var(--color-primary))`
- Custom properties are case-sensitive — `--my-color` differs from `--My-Color`
- Custom properties inherit by default (unlike most CSS properties)
- Use `@property` for typed, animatable custom properties — enables type checking
  (invalid values fall back to `initial-value`), controlled inheritance
  (`inherits: false`), and transitions on custom properties

## View Transitions

- `view-transition-name` must be unique per page at transition time
- Keep transitions short — 200-400ms for UI, longer for page-level
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` for view transitions
- Same-document (SPA): `document.startViewTransition(() => { /* update DOM */ })`
- Cross-document (MPA): `@view-transition { navigation: auto; }`
- Named transitions target specific elements via `::view-transition-group(name)`

## Box Model and Sizing

- Always set `box-sizing: border-box` globally via reset
- `rem` for font sizes and breakpoints — respects user preferences
- `em` for component-relative spacing (padding that scales with font size)
- Fluid sizing with `clamp()` — replace manual breakpoint ladders
- `aspect-ratio` over padding hacks for maintaining proportions
- No units on zero values — `margin: 0` not `margin: 0px`
  (except where required: `flex: 0 0 0px`)
- Leading zero on decimals: `opacity: 0.5` not `opacity: .5`
- Shorthand hex where possible: `#ebc` not `#eebbcc`

## SCSS / Dart Sass

### Module System

- `@use` and `@forward` only — `@import` is deprecated (Dart Sass 1.80.0),
  removed in 3.0.0
- `@use` must appear before any rules except `@forward`
- Namespace defaults to the last component of the URL (without extension)
- Members are scoped to the loading file — not globally available
- Each module loaded exactly once — no duplicate CSS output
- Namespace access: `variables.$primary` not global `$primary`
- No-namespace `@use 'variables' as *` — use sparingly, only for own files
- `math.div()` for division — the `/` operator is deprecated
- Prefix private members with `-` or `_`
- Prefer mixins over `@extend` — more predictable output; `@extend` produces
  unexpected selectors and doesn't work across media queries
- Max nesting: 3 levels

`@forward` re-exports modules, supports prefixing and visibility control.
Module configuration uses `!default` variables and `@use ... with ()`.
See `references/scss.md` for `@forward` patterns, configuration passthrough,
built-in module usage, and file organization conventions.

### Migration

Use the official migrator: `sass-migrator module --migrate-deps entrypoint.scss`.
For built-in functions only: `sass-migrator module --built-in-only entrypoint.scss`.

## CSS Methodologies

### BEM (Block Element Modifier)

- Blocks are standalone components: `.card`, `.nav`, `.form`
- Elements are parts of a block (double underscore): `.card__title`, `.card__image`
- Modifiers are variations (double hyphen): `.card--featured`, `.card__title--bold`
- Never nest elements: `.card__header__title` is wrong — flatten to `.card__title`
  or create a new block
- Modifiers don't exist alone — always pair with base class:
  `class="card card--featured"`
- Use BEM in team projects, large codebases, projects without scoped styles
- Skip BEM when using CSS Modules, utility-first CSS, or small projects

### CSS Modules

- Use simple, descriptive class names — scoping eliminates conflict risk
- One module per component
- Compose shared styles: `composes: resetButton from './shared.module.css'`
- Global escape hatch: `:global(.utility-class)` when needed
- Pair with custom properties for theming (variables aren't scoped)

### Architecture (ITCSS)

Organize styles by specificity, low to high: Settings → Tools → Generic →
Elements → Objects → Components → Utilities. Maps naturally to cascade layers:
`@layer settings, generic, elements, objects, components, utilities;`

## Formatting

- 2-space indentation, no tabs
- One declaration per line
- Semicolon after every declaration including the last
- Space after colon: `color: red` not `color:red`
- Opening brace on same line as selector
- Blank line between rules
- Lowercase everything (selectors, properties, values, hex colors)
- Single quotes for attribute selectors and font names
- Group declarations by category: layout → box model → typography →
  visual → interaction

## Application

When **writing** CSS:
- Apply all conventions silently — don't narrate each rule being followed.
- Use intrinsic sizing and fluid techniques before media queries.
- If an existing codebase contradicts a convention, follow the codebase and
  flag the divergence once.

When **reviewing** CSS:
- Cite the specific violation and show the fix inline.
- Don't lecture or quote the rule — state what's wrong and how to fix it.

```
Bad review comment:
  "According to CSS best practices, you should avoid using ID selectors
   for styling because they have high specificity."

Good review comment:
  "`#header` -> `.header` -- IDs create specificity 1-0-0, difficult to override."
```

## Integration

The coding skill governs workflow; this skill governs CSS implementation
choices. For SCSS, this single skill covers both CSS and SCSS conventions.

**Predictability is the highest CSS virtue. When in doubt, keep specificity low
and cascade explicit.**
