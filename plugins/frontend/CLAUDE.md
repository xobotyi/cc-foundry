## Plugin Scope

This plugin covers frontend platform concerns specific to building for the browser.
Language-specific skills (JavaScript/TypeScript) are provided by the `javascript` plugin.
Framework skills (React, Vue, Svelte) cover framework-specific conventions; the `css` and
`accessibility` skills are framework-agnostic and apply across all frontend work.
