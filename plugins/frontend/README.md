# frontend

Frontend platform discipline plugin for Claude Code.

## The Problem

Browser development requires specialized knowledge beyond general programming — CSS layout
systems, accessibility standards, cross-browser compatibility, and performance
considerations. Generic coding skills don't capture these platform-specific patterns.

## The Solution

Provides skills that teach Claude browser-specific practices: CSS methodologies,
accessibility patterns, and frontend architecture conventions. Keeps platform discipline
separate from language discipline (JavaScript/TypeScript).

## Installation

```
/plugin marketplace add xobotyi/cc-foundry
/plugin install frontend
```

## Skills

### css

CSS conventions, methodologies, and patterns. **Use when:** writing, reviewing, refactoring,
debugging, or understanding CSS and styling code.
